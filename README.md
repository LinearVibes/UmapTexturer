# UmapTexturer  
UmapTexturer is a simple tool that helps you apply or replace textures in `.umap` files after importing them into Blender. This tool makes the process easier and faster.  

### Features:  
Apply textures in imported `.umap` files  
Speeds up the texturing process in Blender  
Simple and easy to use  

**Important:** This tool **only works** if you imported your Unreal Engine maps into Blender using [MinshuG's Umap Importer](https://www.patreon.com/minshug).  (Free Version ofc)

### How to Use:  
1. Import your `.umap` file into Blender using the MinshuG plugin.
2. Go other to the scripting tab in blender 
3. Open UmapTexturer code and select your imported map.  
4. Run the script and you're done.  

### Limitations:  
Some textures may not be 100% accurate. The script might occasionally assign the wrong texture, so manual adjustments may be needed.
